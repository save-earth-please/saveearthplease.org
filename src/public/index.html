      <li>Try to <strong>budget for only 1.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide
          emissions</strong> or less per year. This is the amount we have
        available - split fairly between everyone on Earth - to keep the planet
        mostly hospitable for our foreseeable future.</li>
      <li>Avoid flying. Flying economy Europe to USA emits about 0.5 to 1 tonnes
        per passenger, Europe to Australia about 2 tonnes per passenger - <a

      </li>
      <li>Avoid plastic, especially single-use plastic. Using 0.5 tonnes in a
        year of plastic produces over 0.9 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions -

          href="https://www.ciel.org/plasticandclimate/">CIEL</a>.</li>
      <li>Switch to energy from renewable sources. Generating household-sized
        energy of between 5000 and 10000 kilowatthours from coal for a year
        requires produces about 4.5 to 9.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide - <a
          href="#eia1" aria-describedby="footnotes-title" id="eia1-ref">EIA</a>.
        Renewables, in comparison, do not produce these emissions.

      <h2>What is a fair amount of emissions to produce in a year?</h2>
      <p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer"
          href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris_en">Paris
          Agreement</a> aims for a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
        compared to 1990 levels. That would mean a target of about
        12.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions, for example. (In 2018, over
        33.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide were emitted - <a
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          href="https://www.iea.org/geco/emissions/">IEA</a>). This means there
        is
        a personal carbon dioxide budget of about 1.6 tonnes for each person on
        Earth. At the moment, 4.3 tonnes is produced for each person.</p>
      <h2>Am I allowed to do anything?</h2>
      <p>The above suggestions are not strict rules about what you can and
        cannot do. The main point is to recognise that we each have a fair share
        of the emissions and we should budget that well so that we can live
        comfortably now and for many years into the future. By reducing
        emissions now, we reduce the severity of the climate crisis for the
        already turbulent decades ahead of us. Please consider engaging in
        emission offset programs if you produce over your fair share of 1.6
        tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in a year. Spending time with
        friends, explore nearby parks and cultural points of interests, read, do
        something creative. There are plenty of ways to enjoy life on Earth
        while having a minimal impact on its ecosystems.</p>
      <h2>Isn't this the responsibility of big industrial polluters?</h2>
      <p>Avoiding catastrophic climate change is everyone's responsibility, I
        believe. It requires a heroic, global team effort to avoid a future for
        Earth that is looking increasingly dire. Of course this includes the big
        polluters pulling their weight. However, when we consumers purchase
        indirectly or directly from the big polluters, we are pulling at the
        supply chain that keeps the big polluters in business. In this way,
        their failure to properly address the climate crisis is also our
        failure. Let's identify the ways we are doing this, then put our money
        and time into activities that will save Earth instead.</p>

          <li id="eia1">According to <a rel="noopener noreferrer"
              href='https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&t=11'>EIA</a>,
            the US produced a total of 2453119116 short tons (2225455063 metric
            tonnes) of CO2 from its usage of coal as an energy source in 2017.
            The EIA also reports that the US generated 2411670550 megawatthours
            from coal in the same year. Dividing the emissions by the
            megawatthours results in 0.9227856860 metric tonnes of carbon
            produced per megawatthour. <a href="#eia1-ref"

      <h3>About this project</h3>
      <p>This site was created after I realised that I was dramatically
        overspending my fair share of carbon emissions despite there being no
        obvious warning signs. Prior to informing myself using a carbon dioxide
        emissions calculator, I thought I was easily offsetting a flight abroad
        to see my family by eating a mostly vegan diet. The emissions calculator
        revealed that a year of eating vegan food - while reducing a helpful 0.7
        tonnes of emissions - did not even come close to offsetting my flights
        which emit somewhere between about 2 and 10 tonnes of carbon dioxide
        (depending in which calculation is used). Now that I know this, I can
        work towards reducing and offsetting these outsized emissions to live
        within my budget of 1.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year. It
        took coincidentally listening to a couple of talks on climate change,
        followed by active research to realise that I was overspending my
        personal emissions budget. With saveearthplease.org, I would like to
        document my findings so it is easy for everyone to recognise their own
        current emissions spending and then create personal emission budgets to
        make the most out of life while helping slow down the climate crisis we
        find ourselves in.</p>
