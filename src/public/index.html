      <h2>What is a fair amount of emissions to produce in a year?</h2>
      <p>The <a
          href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris_en">Paris
          Agreement</a> aims for a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
        compared to 1990 levels. That would mean a target of about
        12.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions, for example. (In 2018, over
        33.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide were emitted - <a
          href="https://www.iea.org/geco/emissions/">IEA</a>). This means there
        is
        a personal carbon dioxide budget of about 1.6 tonnes for each person on
        Earth. At the moment, 4.3 tonnes is produced for each person.</p>
      <h2>Am I allowed to do anything?</h2>
      <p>The above suggestions are not strict rules about what you can and
        cannot do. The main point is to recognise that we each have a fair share
        of the emissions and we should budget that well so that we can live
        comfortably now and for many years into the future. By reducing
        emissions now, we reduce the severity of the climate crisis for the
        turbulent decades ahead of us. Please consider engaging in emission
        offset programs if you produce over your fair share of 1.6 tonnes of
        carbon dioxide emissions in a year. Spending time with friends, explore
        nearby parks and cultural points of interests, read, do something
        creative. There are plenty of ways to enjoy life on Earth while having
        a minimal impact on its ecosystems.</p>
      <h2>Isn't this the responsibility of big industrial polluters?</h2>
      <p>Avoiding catastrophic climate change is everyone's responsibility. It
        requires a heroic, global team effort to avoid a future for Earth that
        is looking increasingly dire. This of course includes the big polluters
        pulling their weight. However, when we consumers purchase indirectly or
        directly from the big polluters, we are pulling at the supply chain that
        keeps the big polluters in business. In this way, their failure to
        properly address the climate crisis is also our failure. If a
        significant number of us stop pulling on the supply chain in this way
        though, they will not be able to continue - we should use this power
        that we have.</p>

      <h3>About this project</h3>
      <p>This site was created after I realised that I was dramatically
        overspending my fair share of carbon emissions despite there being no
        obvious warning signs. Prior to informing myself using a carbon dioxide
        emissions calculator, I thought I was easily offsetting a flight abroad
        to see my family by eating a mostly vegan diet. The emissions calculator
        revealed that a year of eating vegan food - while reducing a helpful 0.7
        tonnes of emissions - did not even come close to offsetting my flights
        which emitted close to 10 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Now that I know
        this, I can work towards reducing and offsetting these outsized
        emissions to live within my budget of 1.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide
        emissions per year. It took coincidentally listening to a couple of
        talks on climate change, followed by active research to realise that I
        was overspending my personal emissions budget. With saveearthplease.org,
        I would like to document my findings so it is easy for others to
        recognise their own current emissions spending and then create personal
        emission budgets to make the most out of life while helping slow down
        the climate crisis we find ourselves in.</p>
